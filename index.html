                Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world
                population with some countries and entities actively fighting
                against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds
                holding the fort.

                Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of
                tokens launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with
                some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass
                adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far
                down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple
                words to their followers and have them download an app, buy into
                the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
                investment as is with other crypto currency project.
                <br /><br />We are trying to do to this space what investment
                apps did for the "nonexistent retail investors". We are
                gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular faces instead of
                hard to understand projects to make it the norm and
                inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for a lot of people to
                finally give this space a real look.

                A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as
                powerful as countries and creators would be paid beyond the
                peanuts that conventional social media platforms can offer.
